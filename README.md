 Music mod for the Unofficial Homestuck Collection
 
# So, what is this?
This is a mod for the [Unofficial Homestuck Collection](https://github.com/Bambosh/unofficial-homestuck-collection), a offline application for Homestuck & more. Homestuck has had many flashes with music attached to them, with almost every flash having a unique song.

In 2016, the [Cool and New Music Team](https://coolandnewwebcomic.bandcamp.com/), a music team consisting of dozens of Homestuck fans, created three [Cool and New Homestuck](https://coolandnewwebcomic.bandcamp.com/album/cool-and-new-homestuck) albums rescoring and remixing nearly every single flash in Homestuck. This mod aims to replace the songs **every** single Flash with it's rescored counterpart (if it exists). On top of that, the mod aims to add proper credits to every single one, built right into the collection.

- NOTICE -

This project is far from finished. There are hundreds of flashes, with some of them having multiple songs at once. 
Additionally, many flashes only have audio that's baked into the .swf file, meaning the only way to replace it as 
of right now is to modify the .swf itself, which will take much more time. Check the chart below for information 
on every flash for progress.

# Status
**NOTE: 'HQ Audio' means the flash has a separate audio file. If it doesn't, the audio file is baked into the .swf file.**
